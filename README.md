This is solely a public benefit website created according to Dr. Meghan Burke's visions.

Checkout the About page of the website for further information:

Welcome to Access Urbana-Champaign! The purpose of Access Urbana-Champaign is to provide information about accessibility-friendly restaurants in the Champaign-Urbana area. To gather these data, undergraduate and graduate students in Special Education at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign completed an accessibility survey for each restaurant. Upon clicking on an individual restaurant, you will be able to see the results of the survey. 

We hope that information about accessibility will be useful to consumers and restaurants alike in the Champaign-Urbana area. Notably, this project is a replication of a similar project (i.e., Access Nashville) conducted as part of the Vanderbilt Kennedy Center and Tennessee Disability Pathfinder. 

For questions and concerns, please contact Meghan Burke (meghanbm@illinois.edu).
